      <h3>About Me</h3>
         <p>
            I was born in Edison, NJ and am currently still currently living there today.
            I currently work as a Data Analyst for SMBC, and am looking to get more into 
            Software Development. Some of my hobbies include playing soccer, playing basketball,
            watching Netflix, and playing video games with friends.
